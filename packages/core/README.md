# @cpro-js/react-core

Re-export of our base libraries to develop react apps:

- @cpro-js/react-app-state
- @cpro-js/react-di
- @cpro-js/react-i18n

It's recommended to install only `@cpro-js/react-core` to eliminate the need of managing versions for the listed libs above.

## Installation

```
$ yarn add @cpro-js/react-core
```
